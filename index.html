				<p>I think that neuroscience and astrophysics are alter egos! Aren't there billions of firing stars being studied in both? Unfathomable!</p>
				<p>I enjoy doing research in Cognitive Science, Biological Psychology and Neuropharmacology.
I currently work as a research assistant at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (IBB), University of Tehran.</p>
				<p>* Other affiliations: 1) Dept Physiology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences 2) Neuroscience Research Center, SBMU.</p>
				<p>** Main research interests: 1) Learning and memory deficits in neurodegeneration (AD) 2) Developing tools and protocols to study high-level sensorimotor processing 3) Reward and pain circuitry: molecular architecture and signaling in cortex 4) Machine learning and deep learning 5) Neuroinformatics and systems neuroscience 6) Psychophysics / Attention / Perception and Computational neuroscience 7) Neuropharmacology of atypical antipsychotics (in SCZ-related suicide, etc.) 8) Visuotopy, retinotopy, somatotopy, somatosensory corticesâ€™ spatial/field 9) Neurobiology of psychiatric and affective disorders, etc.</p>
				<p>*** Interested techniques: Electrophysiology (Extracellular Single Unit Recording, Local Field Potential Recording), Optogenetics, Neuroimaging (fMRI, SPECT, FNIRS, MEG, and Multi-photon laser imaging), Patch clamp, Behavioral paradigms (Rodent, monkey, and human reward and learning tasks: CPP, PAL, Decision-making mazes, Iowa Gambling Task, etc.)</p>
